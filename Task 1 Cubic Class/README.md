# Week 14 Task 1

In this task, we will extend the Parabola class we wrote in class to a Cubic class for cubic functions c3 * x**3 + c2*x**2 + c1*x + c0

Our in-class code is provided as a starting point. Implement the Cubic class by inheriting from the Parabola class, and reuse methods and data in the Parabola class, in the same way as the Parabola class reuses methods and data in the Line class.

Finally, use the table() function of a Cubic object to plot a cubic function of your choice.
